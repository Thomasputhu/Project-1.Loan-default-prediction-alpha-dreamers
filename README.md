## Introduction
Welcome to the Loan Default Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing loan default data within Dreamers Banking Consortium. The objective of this project is to examine patterns and factors associated with loan defaults and develop a predictive model to forecast default risk.

## Project Overview
- **Data:** The dataset used in this analysis is provided in this repository.
- **Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are utilized to uncover insights into the relationships between different features and loan defaults.
- **Modeling:** Machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, are utilized to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on applicant characteristics.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks:** Contains Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Documentation:** Includes supplementary documentation, such as project requirements, data dictionaries, and README files.
